{\bf KOMODO HEALTH,} San Francisco, CA \\
{\em Data Engineer} \hfill
Mar 2015 -- Present \\
As employee \#3, I have had the opportunity to add value in different parts of the engineering stack, from scratch: \\                                          \vspace{-4mm}

\begin{itemize}                                         \itemsep1pt %\small
  \item Design and implement distributed (Spark, S3) and automated (Airflow) data pipelines that process multiple external data sources to deliver mission-critical insights to end-users

  \item Lead implementation of internal services (containerized Flask APIs deployed on Kubernetes) that improve transparency (domain-knowledge driven data metrics tracking) and automation (config and metadata tracking)

  \item Deploy and maintain the data infrastructure (AWS, Spark, Airflow, internal services) that support the data team (13+ developers), leveraging container technologies (Kubernetes, Docker)

  \item Work with architect and product managers to define requirements and roadmap for scalability of data deployment, data ingestion and internal tooling.
