{\bf MYTHIC, INC,} Redwood City, CA \\
{\em Senior Deep Learning Engineer} \hfill
Sep 2018 -- Present \\
Mythic is creating first-of-its-kind mixed signal chip to speed up neural network inference on the edge. As part of the software team:\\

\begin{itemize}                                         \itemsep1pt %\small
  \item Developing Keras-based quantization tool that models and mitigates hardware effects during training
  \item Improving in-house Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) customized for our hardware
  \item Built a large labeled video dataset ($>$5M annotations) by creating specs, working with contractors, and setting up data ingestion/processing
\end{itemize}

{\bf KOMODO HEALTH,} San Francisco, CA \\
{\em Data Engineer} \hfill
Mar 2015 -- May 2017 \\
As employee \#3, I have had the opportunity to add value in different parts of the engineering stack, from scratch: \\                                          \vspace{-4mm}

\begin{itemize}                                         \itemsep1pt %\small
  \item Designed and implemented distributed (Spark, S3) and automated (Airflow) data pipelines that process multiple external data sources to deliver mission-critical insights to end-users

  \item Led implementation of internal services (containerized Flask APIs deployed on Kubernetes) that improve transparency (domain-knowledge driven data metrics tracking) and automation (config and metadata tracking)

  \item Built and maintained the data infrastructure (AWS, Spark, Airflow, internal services) that support the data team (13+ developers), leveraging container technologies (Kubernetes, Docker)

  \item Worked with architect and product managers to define requirements and roadmap for scalability of data deployment, data ingestion and internal tooling.
